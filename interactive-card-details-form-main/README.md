## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media querie
- Vue data
- Vue computed
- vue event management
- Mobile-first workflow
- [CSS Tools](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - Reset CSS
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Fonts imports for typography
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS language preprocessor
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework

### What I learned

Returns different classes according to conditions.

```js
template: `<div :class="className"><p>Hello</p></div>`,

data(){
  return {
    active: true
  }
},

computed: {
  className() {
    return {
      errors: !this.active,
      active: this.active
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Thereafter, I will work on the simplification of the forms, the management of their events and their errors as well as their customizations.
